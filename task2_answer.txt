Q1 Answer--> The model underfits with very few nodes (1–3), resulting in low accuracy and straightforward decision limits. Accuracy increases with moderate nodes (5–20), the model learns complicated boundaries. Accuracy may increase with more than fifty nodes, but overfitting danger increases.

Q2 Answer--> The capacity of the model is increased by adding more hidden nodes.  Up to a certain ideal range, accuracy increases.
